<p align="center">This project is in an extremely early state. I won't provide support of any kind, neither do I take responsibility for data loss, etc. in a case a software fault. This script blocks any request outside a halflife game! So if you're running any web-based place to provide maps, you should stick with the normal fastdl system.</p>
